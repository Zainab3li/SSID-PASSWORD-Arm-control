# SSID-PASSWORD-Arm-control
In this task I have created a page with SSID (Network Name and Password), all fields are required so if user does not enter SSID or password a message will appear (pleas fill out this field). When you click on the login button, you will be taken to the arm control page. The arm control page consists of 6 engines each with a range slider (0-90Â°) on this page there are back buttons (SSID page) and next button (direction page).
